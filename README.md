## System Requirements

- **Architecture**: RISC-V 64-bit
- **Emulator**: QEMU RISC-V system emulation
- **Toolchain**: RISC-V GNU toolchain
- **Build System**: GNU Make

## Building ChipOS

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chipos.git
cd chipos

# Build the OS
make clean && make

# Run in QEMU
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -bios none -kernel build/kernel.bin -nographic
```

## Quick Start

After booting ChipOS, you'll see the interactive shell. Try these commands:

```bash
# Explore the filesystem
ls
mkdir myproject
cd myproject

# Create and edit files
touch program.c
edit program.c
# (Write some C code with syntax highlighting)

# View files with syntax highlighting
cat program.c

# System information
about
mem
```

## Supported Languages

### C/C++ (.c, .h)
- Keyword highlighting for control structures, data types
- Comment and string literal highlighting
- Preprocessor directive support

### Verilog/SystemVerilog (.v, .sv)
- Module, always, and wire keyword highlighting
- Port and signal highlighting
- Comment support

### RISC-V Assembly (.s, .asm)
- Instruction highlighting (arithmetic, logic, memory, control)
- Register name highlighting (both x and ABI names)
- Label and comment support
- Number format support (hex, decimal, binary)

## ðŸŽ® Shell Commands

### File Operations
- `ls [dir]` - List directory contents
- `cd <dir>` - Change directory  
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `mkdir <dir>` - Create directory
- `rmdir <dir>` - Remove directory
- `rm <file>` - Remove file
- `touch <file>` - Create empty file
- `cat <file>` - Display file with syntax highlighting

### System Commands

- `:q` - Quit without saving
- `:wq` - Save and quit
- Navigation with arrow keys
- Insert mode for editing

## Architecture

ChipOS is structured as a microkernel with the following components:

```
ChipOS/
â”œâ”€â”€ boot/           # Boot loader and linker scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ kernel/         # Core kernel components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ drivers/    # Hardware drivers (UART, console)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ memory/     # Memory management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shell/      # Interactive shell
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ editor/     # Text editor with syntax highlighting
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fs/         # Filesystem implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/            # Standard library functions
â””â”€â”€ build/          # Build artifacts
```

## Educational Value
